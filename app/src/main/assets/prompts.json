  "Exact face, hair, skin tone, facial expression, eye direction, mouth shape, body proportions, pose, hand positions, fingers, background and lighting from the first image only - do not change anything else; completely remove every piece of existing clothing and replace the entire outfit (top, bottom, underwear, outerwear, dress, shoes, socks, belts, bags, jewelry, hats, glasses, every accessory) with the exact clothes worn/shown in the second image - if the second image contains a person, ignore their entire body and face and extract only their clothing items with their precise cut, fit, fabric behavior, wrinkles, patterns, colors and details; apply the full new outfit to the person from the first image even on body parts that are hidden or barely visible in the first image by intelligently inferring and generating the missing areas for perfect coverage and natural fit, ultra-realistic fabric physics, correct shadows and highlights, high resolution, no artifacts, no blending with original clothes whatsoever.",
  "Using image 1 as the base, keep the same person’s body, face, hair, pose, lighting, and background from image 1, but completely remove and ignore all original clothing and instead dress the person in a full outfit that exactly copies every visible item of clothing and accessory from image 2 (tops, shirts, jackets, coats, pants, jeans, shorts, skirts, dresses, shoes, socks, hats, belts, bags, jewelry, etc.), even if they are only partly visible, so that 100% of the original clothes are replaced and the new clothes fit naturally with correct perspective, realistic proportions, folds, textures, and shadows at high resolution.",
  "Replace the outfit on the person in the first uploaded image with the exact clothing shown in the second uploaded image. Extract only the clothes from the second image, ignoring any person, background, or other elements in it. Precisely match the style, color, texture, patterns, and details of the clothes while preserving the original pose, body shape, facial features, expression, skin tone, hair, accessories (unless part of the outfit), lighting, shadows, background, and overall composition from the first image. Adjust the new clothes to fit naturally on the subject's body with realistic folds, wrinkles, and draping. Output a high-resolution, photorealistic edited image in the same aspect ratio as the first image.",
  "Strictly preserve the identity, face, body shape, pose, and background of the subject in the first image while replacing their attire by extracting only the clothing garments, textures, and patterns visible in the second image—regardless of whether the source clothes are worn by another person or a flat lay—and apply them to the first subject with photorealistic draping, lighting consistency, and accurate fabric physics."
